# Migration

This directory contains module migrations that are used when upgrading app versions.

Note: celestia-app uses a versioned module manager and configurator to manage migrations (see `app/module` for details) so migrations in this folder don't follow the pattern described by the Cosmos SDK x/upgrade module.
