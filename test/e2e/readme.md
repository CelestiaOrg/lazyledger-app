# End-to-End Testing

Celestia uses the [knuu](https://github.com/celestiaorg/knuu) framework to orchestrate clusters of nodes in a network for end-to-end testing. This relies on Docker and a kubeconfig (in `~/.kube/config`) to access the Kubernetes cluster.

End-to-end tests pull docker images from `ghcr.io/celestiaorg/celestia-app`. These are automatically published when tagging a new release or when opening a pull request. If you wish to manually test a specific commit, you can manually publish the image by first running `make build-ghcr-docker` (from the root directory) and then running `make publish-ghcr-docker`. You must have permission to push to the `ghcr.io/celestiaorg/celestia-app` repository.

## Usage

**Prerequisite: Requires a kubeconfig file.**

You can run the End-to-End tests using either of the following commands:

```shell
go run ./test/e2e```

```shell
make test-e2e
```

To run a specific test, you can pass the name of the test as a command-line argument. For example, to run the "E2ESimple" test, you would use either of the specified commands:

```shell
go run ./test/e2e E2ESimple
```

```shell
make test-e2e E2ESimple  
```

**Optional parameters**:

- `KNUUU_TIMEOUT` can be used to override the default timeout of 60 minutes for the tests.

## Observation

Logs of each of the nodes are posted to Grafana and can be accessed through Celestia's dashboard (using the `test` namespace).

### Metrics

To view the metrics from the testnet, you should set the `GRAFANA_ENDPOINT`, `GRAFANA_USERNAME`, and `GRAFANA_TOKEN` environment variables. This uses Prometheus alongside the Jaeger and Otlp Exporter.

## Running locally

It is also possible to run the whole workloads locally using minikube.

### Backup existing configuration

By default, the instructions below will overwrite your existing cluster configuration. To back up your configuration:

```shell
cp ${HOME}/.kube/config ${HOME}/.kube/config_backup
```

This will back up your default kubernetes configuration. If you use a different directory/file, and you plan on referencing it when creating the minikube cluster below, please back it up.

### Install minikube

Minikube is required to be installed on your machine. If you have a linux machine, follow the [minikube docs](https://kubernetes.io/fr/docs/tasks/tools/install-minikube/). If you're on macOS ARM, this [tutorial](https://devopscube.com/minikube-mac/) can be helpful to run it using qemu.

### Create namespace

The command in [usage](#usage) specifies an environment variable `KNUU_NAMESPACE` to the value `test`. This namespace will need to be created before running that command:

```shell
kubectl create namespace test
```

If another namespace is to be used, please create it using the same command while changing `test` to your target namespace.

### Check the logs

After you start the E2E tests, you can check if you have the validators running:

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace test
NAME                             READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
timeout-handler-09e1a426-jwm7n   1/1     Running   0          2m18s
timeout-handler-921a1b93-52g6d   1/1     Running   0          40m
timeout-handler-c3442f46-lvxw2   1/1     Running   0          37m
timeout-handler-f5ccc2c9-7hld2   1/1     Running   0          34m
val0-3a7e2e1e-zs8h5              1/1     Running   0          60s
val1-9b802df8-tcvnb              1/1     Running   0          51s
val2-91b57a4d-ht57t              1/1     Running   0          42s
val3-dcc2ef6c-cg8k5              1/1     Running   0          32s
```

The logs can be checked using:

```shell
kubectl logs --namespace test -f <pod_name>
```

With `<pod_name>` being a pod name like `val0-3a7e2e1e-zs8h5`.

### Destroy the pods

By default, the pods will be killed automatically after 60 minutes. However, if you want to clean up the cluster manually, and destroy everything that was created in the `test` namespace:

```shell
kubectl delete pods --all --namespace test
```

Note: This will delete all the created pods in the default kubernetes cluster under the `test` namespace. Make sure to run it against the correct cluster and double-check the pods list that is going to be destroyed using this command:

```shell
kubectl get pods --namespace test
```

### Restoring old cluster configuration

To restore your previous cluster configuration, if you followed the [backup your existing cluster configuration](#backup-existing-configuration) section:

```shell
cp ${HOME}/.kube/config_backup ${HOME}/.kube/config
```
